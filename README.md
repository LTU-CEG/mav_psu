# 5.3V/3A output DCDC converter

A simple 5.3V output / 21V input max DCDC converter using high quality components,
has output capacitance of 200 uF to help with pulsed loads.

All passives are 0603 or bigger to facilitate hand soldering, while all vias are
0.4 mm drill or larger to make manufacturing cheaper (recommended to use 2 oz
copper layers).
