# 5.3V/3A output DCDC converter

A simple 5.3V output / 21V input max DCDC converter using high quality components,
has output capacitance of 200 uF to help with pulsed loads. The PSU pads have
castelated vias to make it possible to solder this PSU as a module on another
board.

All passives are 0603 or bigger to facilitate hand soldering, while all vias are
0.4 mm drill or larger to make manufacturing cheaper (recommended to use 2 oz
copper layers).

Designed to power the "computations" computer on MAVs, such as the Aaeon UP board.
